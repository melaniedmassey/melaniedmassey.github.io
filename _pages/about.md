I've been enthralled by the natural world since I was a chid. Despite – or perhaps, in spite of – growing up in downtown Toronto without a childhood pet, I developed a fondness for animals and an appreciation for the diversity of life on this planet. I'm now a member of <a href = "https://mandraklab.ca/"> Dr. Nick Mandrak's </a> lab at UTSC as a Liber Ero Fellow. Here, I'm working on the ecophysiology and human dimensions of invasive goldfish.
